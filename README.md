The Go package isoweek calculates a starting date and time of ISO 8601
week.

ISO 8601 standard defines the common week numbering system used in Europe
and many other countries. Monday is the first day of a week.

The Go standard library "time" package has ISOWeek() function for getting
ISO 8601 week number of a given Time, but there is no reverse functionality
for getting a date from a week number. This package implements that.

Invalid input is silently accepted. There is a separate Validate()
function if week number validation is needed.

There are also functions for working with Julian day numbers. Using Julian
day numbers is often the easiest and fastest way to do date calculations.

This package does not work with the week system used in US/Canada/Australia
(weeks starting on Sundays). However the Julian day number functions
may be still useful.

Examples
--------

### Using weeks with Go standard time.Time

A simple example which gets the starting time of the 1st week of 1985:
```Go
	t := isoweek.StartTime(1985, 1, time.UTC)
	fmt.Println(t)
	// Output: 1984-12-31 00:00:00 +0000 UTC
```
The returned time may be within a previous year as can be seen above.

The AddDate() function in Go standard library "time" package can be used
for getting the Time at the end of the week or for iterating through weeks:
```Go
	t = t.AddDate(0, 0, 7)
	fmt.Println(t)
	// Output: 1985-01-07 00:00:00 +0000 UTC

	wyear, week := t.ISOWeek()
	fmt.Println(wyear, week)
	// Output: 1985 2
```

### Using weeks, dates and Julian day numbers

The same as above without using Go standard library "time" package:

```Go
	y, m, d := isoweek.StartDate(1985, 1)
	fmt.Println(y, m, d)
	// Output: 1984 December 31

	jul := isoweek.DateToJulian(y, m, d)
	jul = jul + 7 // next week
	y, m, d = isoweek.JulianToDate(jul)
	fmt.Println(y, m, d)
	// Output: 1985 January 7

	wyear, week := isoweek.FromDate(y, m, d)
	fmt.Println(wyear, week)
	// Output: 1985 2
```
